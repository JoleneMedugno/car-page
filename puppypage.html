<p>This puppy is reffered to people as the beary puppy and I can tell why. They are also called balck and tan Pomeranians<br>
This puppy's extremely fluffy double-layered coat offers heat for winter times. They come in many different colors.<br>
I think that I would probaly love this dog forever if I had one because the are so cute and by looking at pictures that seem very small.  So he would fit<br>
 perfectly  in my hands.</p>

<p>These pugs in the photo are pretty SUPER. Pugs are cute funny dogs to have. They are usually found in a small space.<br> They name comes from the latin word "fist" because their face I guess resembles a humans fist.<br>A few facts about their face their cheecks are actually called "beauty spots". I didn't know this information about pugs but we learn something new every day.<br>
Pugs are very playful and loyal to their owners.</p>

Go to, for more information on Shiba Inus
<a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/shiba-inu#/slide/1">Shibas</a>
<p>These Shiba Inus are from Japan. They are a very intelligent breed who can learn different things.<br>
They tend to be very timid to new owners they have never met before but I feel like when they are in the house for a while then they will get used to you.<br>
With these dogs when you are giving them away you need to give the a responsible owner, one that can tell what disorder it will pass to its puppies<br>
I think these dogs are very cut e but they seem very timid and shy,and also need a lot of caring to keep happy but doesn't evry dog.</p>

<p> These dogs are so beautiful I want every single kind that exists. Huskys are very beautiful dogs that resemble wolves.These dogs can be called "escape artist"<br>
because they are known to run away and dissapear. Huskys are known to shed alot but it all depends on what type of climate they are in<br>
You can tell they are related to wolves becuase of the charaistics listed above. Go to the link above to find out even more interesting charaistics about these<br>

<p> I love German Shepards. These dogs are used for police dogs but they are also very popular american dog. These dogs can be potty trained with a great trick called crate training.<br>
I would use that method over doing it myself. Shepards are also great watch dogs and are prepared to stand gaurd to protect their owners. They also need a daily exersise<br>
to stay heathly.</p>
